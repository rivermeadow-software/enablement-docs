The RiverMeadow platform is a workload mobility solution that enables organizations to migrate, optimize, and modernize workloads (physical servers and virtual machines) from any source to over a dozen target platforms in the public cloud and on-premises.

### Migrate

Rapidly migrate workloads from any source to over a dozen supported targets with 200+ preflight migration checks, integrated automation, and a post-migration automation engine to identify potential migration issues and automate time-consuming post migration tasks.

### Optimize

Optimize servers during the migration process using storage rightsizing, virtual machine rightsizing, and operating system security hardening for Windows and Linux servers using CIS benchmarks.

### Modernize

Modernize servers during the migration process using automated operating system upgrades, automated Microsoft SQL Server upgrades, and Linux operating system conversion.
