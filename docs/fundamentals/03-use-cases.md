One of the benefits of the RiverMeadow platform is its extensive use case addressability to migrate, optimize, and modernize workloads. 

### On-Premises to Public Cloud Migrations
The RiverMeadow platform

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from on-premises or colocation facilities to the public cloud:

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**</summary>

  Migrate VMware vSphere virtual machines running on-premises to AWS EC2

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Microsoft Hyper-V to Microsoft Azure**</summary>

  <summary>**Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines running on Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 or other AWS ecosystem IaaS solutions like ROSA, NC2 or others.

</details>


### VMware On-Premises to Cloud Hosted VMware Migrations

Organizations looking to rapidly exit their on-premises datacenters or colocation facilities as part of a broader transition to the public cloud may utilize cloud hosted VMware solutions (EVS, AVS, GCVE, etc.) as a seamless on-ramp to place workloads close to cloud native services for AI and ML.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from VMware vSphere running on-premises or in a colocation facility to VMware vSphere running in the public cloud:

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Elastic VMware Service (EVS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the AWS managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Service (AVS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the Microsoft managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Google Compute VMware Engine (GCVE)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the Google managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.
