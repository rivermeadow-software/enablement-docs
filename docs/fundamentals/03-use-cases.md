### On-Premises to Public Cloud Migrations

Organizations are continuing to evaluate on-premises to public cloud migrations for various different reasons such as reducing IT operating costs, seeking to drive innovation with AI in the cloud, or optimize IT operations with a cloud operating model. The RiverMeadow platform supports migrating VMware vSphere workloads to public clouds such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from on-premises or colocation facilities to the public cloud:

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**</summary>

  Licensing costs for VMware vSphere is forcing organizations to look for alternatives and AWS EC2 provides robust and battle tested IaaS solution for migrating workloads to as part of a VMware exit. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Microsoft Hyper-V to Microsoft Azure**</summary>

  Migrate Windows and Linux virtual machines running on Microsoft Hyper-V on-premises to Microsoft Azure.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Physical Servers to Google Cloud Engine (GCE)**</summary>

  Many organizations still have applications that are running on physical servers and have not been virtualized for various reasons. The RiverMeadow platform can be used to migrate these workloads with near-zero downtime to Google Cloud Engine (GCE).

### VMware On-Premises to On-Premises VMware Alternatives

Many organizations are looking to migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere on-premises to alternatives on-premises such as Nutanix AHV, HPE Morpheus VM Essentials, Red Hat OpenShift, and others due to rising licensing costs. The RiverMeadow platform includes support for migrating VMware vSphere virtual machines to an extensive number of VMware alternatives.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from VMware vSphere running on-premises to VMware alternatives running on-premises:

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization running on-premises. This enables virtual machines and containers to be run side by side on a single platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to HPE Morpheus VM Essentials**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to HPE Morpheus VM Essentials.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Microsoft Hyper-V**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to Microsoft Hyper-V.

</details>

### Public Cloud to Public Cloud Migrations

Organizations are regularly adopting multi-cloud strategies to reduce the risk of a cloud provider outage impacting the availability of their mission critical applications. The RiverMeadow platform enables the migration of workloads from one public cloud to another to accelerate cloud to cloud migrations.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from one public cloud to another public cloud:

<details>
  <summary>**Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines running on Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 or other AWS ecosystem IaaS solutions like ROSA, NC2 or others.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Alibaba to Amazon Web Services (AWS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines running on Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 or other AWS ecosystem IaaS solutions like ROSA, NC2 or others.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines running on Microsoft Azure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 or other AWS ecosystem IaaS solutions like ROSA, NC2 or others.

</details>


### VMware On-Premises to Cloud Hosted VMware Migrations

Organizations looking to rapidly exit their on-premises datacenters or colocation facilities as part of a broader transition to the public cloud may utilize cloud hosted VMware solutions (EVS, AVS, GCVE, etc.) as a seamless on-ramp to place workloads close to cloud native services for AI and ML. The RiverMeadow platform enables migrating VMware workloads from on-premises to one of the cloud hosted VMware vSphere solutions such as EVS, AVS, GCVE, and others.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable migrations from VMware vSphere running on-premises or in a colocation facility to VMware vSphere running in the public cloud:

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Elastic VMware Service (EVS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the AWS managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Azure VMware Service (AVS)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the Microsoft managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>**VMware vSphere to Google Compute VMware Engine (GCVE)**</summary>

  Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere running on-premises to the Google managed VMware solution using the RiverMeadow platform.

</details>

### Modernization Factory

Technical debt is a major problem for organizations and one that only continues to grow as organizations adopt new technologies. The adoption and implementation of new technologies typically doesn't eliminate the old technology but simply adds another layer that needs care and feeding. The RiverMeadow platform helps address the technical debt from legacy systems with automated OS upgrades, automated Microsoft SQL Server upgrades, and Linux OS conversion.

**Examples**

The following are examples of how the RiverMeadow platform can enable automated large scale modernization initiatives to eliminate organizational technical debt:

<details>
  <summary>**Windows Server Upgrades on VMware vSphere**</summary>

  A powerful use case of the RiverMeadow platform is to utilize the ability to perform automated operating system upgrades without migrating the them to a different platform. This allows organizations to take advantage of this feature without needing to perform a migration.
