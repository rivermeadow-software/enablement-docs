# Workload Optimization
---

There are multiple strategies for migrating workloads that range from a basic "lift and shift" migration of the workload to a complete refactoring of the application. Lift and shift migrations are the quickest and most straightforward way to migrate workloads as you are simply migrating the workload as is. The downside of this strategy is that the workload is typically unoptimized and that technical debt is being brought to the new environment.

### Storage Optimization

Reduce cloud operating costs with recuced

#### Key Benefits

The following are key benefits of the operating system modernization feature:

* **Reduced Cloud Costs:** The clone based methodology reduces the risk associated with in-place upgrades that rely on snapshots and commonly require an extended period of downtime simply for testing the upgrade.
* **Optimized Storage Space:**

**Storage Optimization Examples**

The following are examples of storage optimization that can be completed utilizing the storage rightsizing feature:


<details>
  <summary>**Windows Server 2019 VM with a 2 TB data drive**</summary>

  This is the detailed content

  **Allocated Storage** = 2,000 GB

  **Used Storage** = 600 GB
  
  **Price per GB** = .08
  
  2,000 GB x .08 = $160 USD per month
