# Migration Utility
---
The RiverMeadow migration utility is a lightweight utility (less than 25 MB) that is deployed on Windows or Linux source servers that are migrated using OS based migrations. The OS utility also enables advanced optimization and modernization functionality during the workload migration.

## Automated Deployment
The RiverMeadow utility can be automatically deployed from the migration appliance that is deployed into the target environment. The migration appliance uses remote protocols (SSH, WinRM, SMB) to connect to the source workload and perform the utility deployment.
